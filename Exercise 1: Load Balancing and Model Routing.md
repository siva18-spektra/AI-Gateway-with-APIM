# Exercise 1: Load Balancing and Model Routing 

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Scenario

Contoso Ltd. requires a scalable solution to efficiently manage increasing AI traffic across multiple regions. To ensure high availability, optimal performance, and consistent user experience, the organization is implementing intelligent traffic management using Azure API Management (APIM).

In this exercise, you will configure load balancing, model routing, and session affinity to optimize and control AI request handling across Azure OpenAI services.

## Lab Overview

In this exercise, you will learn how to efficiently distribute and manage AI traffic across multiple Azure OpenAI backends using Azure API Management (APIM). You will configure load balancing to route requests between multiple AI endpoints for improved performance and resilience, set up model routing to direct user requests to specific AI models based on task requirements, and implement session affinity to ensure consistent responses across multi-turn conversations. Using Visual Studio Code and Bicep templates, you’ll deploy multi-region Azure resources, configure APIM for intelligent traffic management, and validate that requests are properly balanced, routed, and maintained across sessions.

## Lab Objectives
In this exercise, you will be performing the following tasks:

- Task 1: Configure load balancing across AOAI resource pools

- Task 2: Set up model routing for directing requests to different models

- Task 3: Implement session affinity to keep responses consistent for agent interactions

## Task 1: Configure load balancing across AOAI resource pools

In this task, you will learn how to distribute incoming AI requests across multiple Azure OpenAI (AOAI) endpoints deployed in different regions. You will configure Azure API Management (APIM) to intelligently route traffic, ensuring high availability, efficient utilization of resources, and seamless failover when one endpoint reaches capacity or becomes unavailable.

    ![](./media/API-gateway-image6.png)

10. Run the **Create deployment using 🦾 Bicep** cell. Here, we use Bicep to define and deploy all necessary Azure resources, including the AI endpoints and APIM service. Running this sets up the infrastructure needed for the lab.

     ![](./media/deploy-e1t1.png)

     >**Note**: If you encounter any errors, wait a few minutes and then re-execute the cell.

     > **Note:** If the deployment fails with a provisioning or deployment error while creating the Foundry resources, the deployment may still be using values stored in the previously generated **params.json** file. In this case, perform the following steps before retrying the deployment:
      >
      > * Open the project folder and locate the generated **params.json** file.
      > * Delete the existing **params.json** file.
      > * Delete and purge any partially created Foundry resources from the Azure portal.
      > * Use a **new resource group name**, **new apim name**. 
      > * You can also try using a different Azure region before retrying the deployment.
      > * Restart the environment/notebook and rerun the steps from the beginning.
      >
      > Following these steps ensures that a fresh deployment configuration is created and prevents reuse of the previous failed deployment parameters.
      >
      >![](./media/params-file.png)

1. Open the **Azure portal** from the desktop. 

   ![](./media/ex1-azport.png)

   >**Note:** If you see the dialog stating **We are now syncing your browsing data across all your devices**, select **Got it** to continue.

   ![](./media/ex1-azport(1).png)

1. In the **Overview** section, you can view the resources that were deployed when the **Create deployment using Bicep** cell was executed.

   ![](./media/ex1-azport(4).png)
    
12. Now, go back to the VS Code and run the cell **Get the deployment outputs**. This section retrieves key information from the deployment, such as API URLs, subscription keys, and resource IDs. We use these outputs to connect and test the AI endpoints in later steps.

    ![](./media/outputs-e1t1.png)
    
14. Run the **Test the API using a direct HTTP call** cell to send multiple requests to the APIM endpoint. Observe the response headers, specifically x-ms-region, to verify which Microsoft Foundry backend region handles each request. This demonstrates APIM's load-balanced pool behavior in action.

      ![](./media/ex1-t1p7.png)

      ![](./media/ex1-t1p7(1).png)

15. Run the cell **Analyze Load Balancing results**. In this section, we analyze the load balancing results to see how traffic is distributed across the AI endpoints. The priority 1 backend handles requests first, and once it reaches its limit, traffic is shared between the two priority 2 backends.

      ![](./media/e1t1p17.png)

      >**Note:** The results you see may differ from the screenshot shown above.

16. Run the cell **Test the API using the Azure OpenAI Python SDK**. In this section, we test the deployed AI endpoints using the Azure OpenAI Python SDK. This ensures that the API requests work correctly and responses are received, regardless of which backend region handles them.

At the end, you know the deployment will run in the correct subscription.

   ![](./media/e1t2p5(2).png)
   
4. Run the cell **Create Deployment using Bicep**. Creates the resource group if needed, writes params.json, and deploys resources using Bicep.
At the end, APIM, AI services, and model routing are provisioned.

   ![](./media/deploy-e1t2.png)

   >**Note**: If you encounter any errors, wait a few minutes and then re-execute the cell.

6. Run the cell **Get Deployment Outputs**. Fetches outputs like APIM URLs, subscription keys, and workspace IDs from the deployment.
At the end, all resource identifiers and API keys are available for testing the deployed services.

    ![](./media/outputs-e1t2.png)
   
8. Run the cell **Test the API using Azure OpenAI Python SDK**. Connects to APIM and sends messages to multiple models to verify routing and responses.

    ![](./media/sdk-e1t2.png)

   >**Note**: At the end, model responses and backend regions are printed to confirm deployment and load balancing.

1. Run the cell **Responses API**. 

   ![](./media/resp-e1t2.png)

## Task 3: Implement session affinity to keep responses consistent for agent interactions

In this task, you will deploy and validate a multi-region Azure setup using Bicep and API Management. You will initialize configuration variables, verify your Azure CLI connection, deploy AI Foundry instances and an API Management gateway, and then test how session affinity affects conversation continuity across backends. By the end, you will see how enabling cookie-based affinity ensures requests from the same client maintain a consistent state across sessions.

1. In Visual Studio Code, under **labs (1)** folder, expand **session-awareness (1)** and then click on **session-awareness.ipynb (2)**.

   ![](./media/e1t3p1.png)

1. Scroll down to **Initialize notebook variables** and enter the following details:

   - resource_group_name: **Q2a-APIM-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

   - resource_group_location: *Use the same region selected in* **Exercise 1 -> Task 1**.

      - `eastus2`
      - `westus` 
      - `westus2`
      - `westus3`
      - `centralus`

         >### **Note:** <span style="color:maroon;"> Use the exact same region that was selected in **Exercise 1 -> Task 1** for all subsequent exercises and tasks in this lab. Using a different region may result in deployment or configuration failures.

   - aiservices_config: 
   
      - **foundry1-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>-e1t3**

      - **foundry3-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>-e1t3**

   - apim_name: **apim-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

      >**Note:** Ensure that the correct name is entered in the respective section.

1. Run the cell **Initialize notebook variables**. By running this cell, you’ll initialize key environment variables used throughout the lab. These include the resource group name and region, AI service configurations, model versions, and API Management settings. Running this cell ensures all necessary parameters are defined before deploying Azure resources and executing the following steps in the notebook.

   ![](./media/apim-may26-e1t3p3.png)

   >**Note:** <span style="color:maroon;"> Select the **Python 3.12.1** kernel from the top bar.
   >
   >![](./media/apim-p2t1p2-new.png)

1. Run the **Verify the Azure CLI and the connected Azure subscription** cell to confirm the Azure CLI is connected and authenticated. It displays your current user, tenant ID, and subscription ID.

   ![](./media/e1t3p3.png)

1. Run the **Create deployment using 🦾 Bicep** cell to deploy all required Azure resources using a Bicep template. This cell creates the resource group (if it doesn’t exist), generates deployment parameters, and provisions two AI Foundry instances, a GPT-4o-mini model in each, an API Management instance, and a backend pool. It sets up the initial environment for the lab, which you’ll later update to enable session affinity.

   ![](./media/deploy-e1t3.png)

   >**Note**: If you encounter any errors, wait a few minutes and then re-execute the cell.

1. Run the **Get the deployment outputs** cell to retrieve details from the completed Bicep deployment. This cell fetches key outputs such as the API Management gateway URL, service name, subscription keys, and deployed AI Foundry instances. It verifies that all resources were successfully created and confirms readiness for testing session affinity in later steps.

   ![](./media/outputs-e1t3.png)

1. Run the **Test Session Awareness Without Affinity** cell to check how requests behave without session affinity. It sends two consecutive OpenAI API calls and logs backend regions, cookies, and response continuity to show whether sessions break across different backends.

   ![](./media/sess-e1t3.png)

   ![](./media/sess-e1t3(1).png)

1. Run the **Enable Session Affinity on Backend Pool** cell to activate cookie-based session affinity. This ensures all requests from the same client are routed to the same backend, maintaining conversation state. The cell updates the backend pool configuration to enable the `APIM-Backend-Affinity` cookie for session stickiness.

   ![](./media/enb-e1t3.png)

   ![](./media/enb-e1t3(1).png)

1. Run the **Test Session Affinity** cell to verify that session affinity is working. With affinity enabled, both API requests should be routed to the same backend, preserving the conversation state. The logs will confirm a consistent backend region and successful session continuity.

   ![](./media/test-e1t3.png)
